# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

St. Andrews Academy Alumni Portal — a single-file SPA for the Batch 1986 alumni of St. Andrews Academy. All logic, styles, seed data, and embedded images live in one file: **`index.html`**.

**Live site:** https://st-andrews-academy.github.io  
**Admin PIN default:** `aneza654457`

## Running the App

No build step. Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or deploy to GitHub Pages by uploading the file to the `st-andrews-academy/st-andrews-academy.github.io` repository (goes live in ~2-5 minutes).

Firestore requires an origin allowed in Firebase; running from `file://` may fail CORS — use a local HTTP server (e.g. `python -m http.server`) or just open from GitHub Pages. There are no package managers, bundlers, linters, or test frameworks in the project itself.

## Testing

No test suite is checked in. For automated browser testing against the live site, use **Playwright** (available via `npx playwright`):

```bash
npm install playwright        # install locally (don't commit node_modules)
npx playwright install chromium
node my_test.mjs              # run tests
rm -rf package.json package-lock.json node_modules my_test.mjs  # clean up
```

**Key patterns for writing tests:**
- Use `waitUntil: 'load'` (not `networkidle`) — Firebase keeps connections open and `networkidle` never fires.
- Wait for `#loadingOverlay` to be hidden before interacting: `page.waitForSelector('#loadingOverlay', { state: 'hidden' })`.
- Modals are closed with explicit Cancel buttons, not Escape — use `page.click('#modalId button:has-text("Cancel")')`.
- After cancelling the PIN modal, the parent modal is still open — close it separately.
- The admin PIN for testing is `aneza654457` (default); read it from `ADMIN_PIN_DEFAULT` in the source.

**Live URLs under test:**

| Target | URL |
|---|---|
| Alumni Portal | `https://st-andrews-academy.github.io` |
| Architecture Diagram | `https://st-andrews-academy.github.io/SAA_Architecture_Diagram.html` |

**Architecture diagram specifics:** The diagram draws SVG arrows via JavaScript on load — add `page.waitForTimeout(1000)` after page load before asserting arrow counts. Key assertions: 8 boxes visible (`#b-dev` through `#b-mob2`), ≥8 `path.arrow-line` elements in the SVG, all PIN access control items present and matching the app's actual behaviour.

## Architecture

### Single-File Structure

All HTML, CSS (in `<style>`), and JavaScript (in `<script>`) are in `index.html`. Images (class portraits, historical photos) are embedded as base64 data URIs, which accounts for the large file size.

### Navigation & Tabs

`showPage(id, btn)` controls which of the 8 tabs is visible: Overview, History, Graduation, Alumni DB, Faculty, Memory Lane, Notices, Settings. Each tab has an `init*()` function called on `DOMContentLoaded`.

**Dashboard-specific reunion sections:**
- **Memory Lane** — stat bar (`#mlReunionStats`) shows 2026 Reunion Grand Total (₱225,200) and Contributors (98), rendered once by `renderEvents()`
- **Faculty** — "2026 Reunion — Teacher Attendance" card (`#facReunionList`) lists attending/absent teachers, rendered by `initFaculty()`
- These sections do not appear on any other dashboard

**Overview page order (top to bottom):**
1. Hero banner
2. "About St. Andrew's Academy" card
3. Stats bar (`#overviewStats`) — Total Alumni, Female, Male, Batches, Sections, Years of Service
4. Two-column: Section Summary table + Batch 1986 Statistics

**Alumni DB page:** shares the same stats bar HTML as Overview (`#dbStats`), populated by the same `statsHtml` variable in `initOverview()`.

**Notices page layout (split-panel):**
- The page uses `display:flex; flex-direction:column; height:calc(100vh - 92px); overflow:hidden` so it fills the viewport below the fixed nav and online banner.
- **Announcements card** (top, `flex:2` ≈ 2/3 of height) — independently scrollable list (`#announcementList`, class `notices-list`). Live search via `#annSearch` filters by title or body text in real time (`oninput="renderAnnouncements()"`).
- **Feedback card** (bottom, `flex:1` ≈ 1/3 of height) — independently scrollable list (`#feedbackList`, class `notices-list`). Live search via `#fbSearch` filters by name or message text in real time (`oninput="renderFeedbackList()"`).
- Both cards have CSS class `notices-card` (`display:flex; flex-direction:column; min-height:0; margin-bottom:0`). When no results match a search term, a contextual "No … match your search." message is shown instead of the default "No … yet." message.

**Settings page boxes (`.setting-group` cards, rendered in a CSS grid):**
1. Database Backup & Restore
2. Export & Import
3. Display Settings
4. Memory Lane Backup
5. Admin PIN Protection
6. Pending Approvals (`#pendingList`)
7. Portal Information — school details and version stamp
8. **Disclaimer** — four-paragraph static notice stating the site is an independent alumni initiative, not the school's official website, with IP/ownership acknowledgment and a contact prompt for content concerns

### Data Layer

**Primary store: Firestore.** On load, `loadFromFirestore()` fetches all data from Firestore and syncs it into localStorage as a cache. If Firestore is unreachable, the app falls back to localStorage (or seed data on first visit). All writes go to both localStorage and Firestore in parallel — Firestore failures are non-fatal (`console.warn` only).

Firebase SDK v10.12.0 compat is loaded via two CDN `<script>` tags (lines 173–174). The global `fstore` variable holds the Firestore instance.

**Firestore collections / documents:**

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `portal/alumni` | `{ records: [...] }` — full alumni array |
| `portal/faculty` | `{ records: [...] }` — full faculty array |
| `portal/config` | `{ adminPin: "..." }` — admin PIN |
| `portal/pending` | `{ records: [...] }` — self-registration submissions |
| `portal/pending_alumni` | `{ records: [...] }` — pending alumni add submissions |
| `portal/pending_faculty` | `{ records: [...] }` — pending faculty add submissions |
| `portal/pending_events` | `{ records: [...] }` — pending event add submissions |
| `portal/pending_edit_alumni` | `{ records: [...] }` — pending alumni edit submissions |
| `portal/pending_edit_faculty` | `{ records: [...] }` — pending faculty edit submissions |
| `portal/pending_edit_events` | `{ records: [...] }` — pending event edit submissions |
| `portal/announcements` | `{ records: [...] }` — announcements (admin-only add/edit/delete) |
| `portal/feedback` | `{ records: [...] }` — approved feedback entries |
| `portal/pending_feedback` | `{ records: [...] }` — pending feedback add submissions |
| `portal/pending_edit_feedback` | `{ records: [...] }` — pending feedback edit submissions |
| `events/{evId}` | Individual event doc; `evId` is `Date.now().toString()` |

Events are stored as individual Firestore documents (not in a single array doc) and carry an `_id` field matching their document ID. `saveEvents()` only writes to localStorage; Firestore writes for events are done explicitly at creation (`fstore.collection('events').doc(evId).set(ev)`), edit (`fstore.collection('events').doc(ev._id).set(ev)`), and deletion (`fstore.collection('events').doc(ev._id).delete()`).

**localStorage keys (cache / fallback):**

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `saa_alumni` | Alumni records array |
| `saa_faculty` | Faculty records array |
| `saa_events` | Memory Lane events array |
| `saa_settings` | `{ fontSize }` |
| `saa_pending_reg` | Self-registration submissions array |
| `saa_pending_alumni` | Pending alumni add submissions array |
| `saa_pending_faculty` | Pending faculty add submissions array |
| `saa_pending_events` | Pending event add submissions array |
| `saa_pending_edit_alumni` | Pending alumni edit submissions array |
| `saa_pending_edit_faculty` | Pending faculty edit submissions array |
| `saa_pending_edit_events` | Pending event edit submissions array |
| `saa_announcements` | Announcements array |
| `saa_feedback` | Approved feedback array |
| `saa_pending_feedback` | Pending feedback add submissions array |
| `saa_pending_edit_feedback` | Pending feedback edit submissions array |
| `saa_admin_pin` | Custom PIN (falls back to default if absent) |

On first load, if Firestore has no data, `ALUMNI_SEED` and `FAC_SEED` are written to both Firestore and localStorage. Existing users see Firestore data on every load, so seed changes in the file are **ignored** for existing users unless Firestore data is cleared.

### Core Data Shapes

```js
// Alumni
{ Student_Code, First_Name, Middle_Initial, Surname, Married_Surname,
  Section, Batch, Gender, Profession, Birthday, Marital_Status,
  Children_Information, Deceased, Remarks,
  Email, Cellphone }   // admin-only — stored in DB, never shown in dashboard tables

// Faculty
{ Faculty_Code, Surname, First_Name, Middle_Initial, Gender, Position,
  Specialization, Year_Start, Year_End, Employment_Status,
  Batches_Advised, Sections_Advised, Birthday, Attended_2026_Reunion, Remarks,
  Email, Cellphone }   // admin-only — stored in DB, never shown in dashboard tables

// Event (Memory Lane)
{ title, date, desc, photos: [base64DataURL, ...], created }

// Pending Registration
{ First_Name, Middle_Initial, Surname, Married_Surname, Section, Batch,
  Gender, Birthday, Profession, Contact, Message, Submitted, Status }

// Announcement (admin-only add/edit/delete)
{ _id, title, body, created }

// Feedback (approved)
{ _id, name, message, created }

// Pending Feedback Add
{ name, message, Submitted }

// Pending Feedback Edit
{ _id, name, message, Submitted, _originalId, _displayName }
```

### Global State

```js
let db;              // Alumni array
let facDB;           // Faculty array
let events;          // Memory Lane events
let settings;        // { fontSize }
let currentFontSize;
let sortCol='Surname', sortDir=1; // Alumni table sort state
let currentPage=1, pageSize=25;   // Alumni pagination (25 rows/page)
let editIdx=-1;                   // -1 = add mode, ≥0 = edit mode for alumni modal
let facSortCol='Surname', facSortDir=1;
let facPage=1, facPageSize=20;    // Faculty pagination (20 rows/page)
let facEditIdx=-1;                // -1 = add mode, ≥0 = edit mode for faculty modal
let _pinCb;          // Pending PIN-protected callback
let editEventIdx;    // -1 = add mode, ≥0 = edit mode for event modal
let pendingPhotos;   // File[] accumulated across multiple file-picker opens
let existingPhotoUrls; // base64[] of photos already saved (edit mode only)
let _pendingObjectUrls; // object URLs created for photo thumbnails — revoked on each redraw and on modal close
let _toastTimer;     // clearTimeout handle so rapid toasts don't race
let announcements;   // Announcements array (Notices tab)
let feedbackDB;      // Approved feedback array (Notices tab)
let editAnnouncementIdx; // -1 = add mode, ≥0 = edit mode for announcement modal
let editFeedbackIdx;     // -1 = add mode, ≥0 = edit mode for feedback modal
```

### PIN Authentication Pattern

`pinThen(fn)` shows the PIN modal and calls `fn()` on success. To add a new PIN-protected action, wrap it: `pinThen(() => yourAction())`.

**Add → Pending queue (no PIN, open to anyone):**
- **Add alumni** — `submitPendingAlumni()` saves to `saa_pending_alumni` / `portal/pending_alumni` for admin approval.
- **Add faculty** — `submitPendingFaculty()` saves to `saa_pending_faculty` / `portal/pending_faculty` for admin approval.
- **Add event** — `submitPendingEvent()` saves to `saa_pending_events` / `portal/pending_events` for admin approval.
- **Submit feedback** — `submitPendingFeedback()` saves to `saa_pending_feedback` / `portal/pending_feedback` for admin approval.
- The Save button in add modals shows "📝 Submit for Approval" (no PIN badge). `saveStudentWithPin` / `saveFacultyWithPin` / `saveEventOrSubmit` / `saveFeedbackOrSubmit` route to the submit path when in add mode.

**Edit → Pending queue (no PIN, open to anyone):**
- **Edit alumni** — `editStudentPin(idx)` opens the modal directly (no PIN). Save calls `submitPendingEditAlumni()` which saves to `saa_pending_edit_alumni` / `portal/pending_edit_alumni`. Save button shows "📝 Submit Edit for Approval". The pending record stores `_originalCode` (Student_Code) and `_displayName` so admin can identify which record is being edited.
- **Edit faculty** — `editFacultyPin(idx)` opens the modal directly (no PIN). Save calls `submitPendingEditFaculty()` → `saa_pending_edit_faculty` / `portal/pending_edit_faculty`. Same pattern as alumni.
- **Edit event** — `openEditEventModal(i)` opens freely. Save calls `submitPendingEditEvent()` → `saa_pending_edit_events` / `portal/pending_edit_events`. Pending record stores `_originalId` (event `_id`) and `_displayName`.
- **Edit feedback** — `openEditFeedbackModal(idx)` opens freely. Save calls `submitPendingEditFeedback()` → `saa_pending_edit_feedback` / `portal/pending_edit_feedback`. Pending record stores `_originalId` (feedback `_id`) and `_displayName`.

**PIN required — Admin only:**
- **Add / Edit / Delete announcements** — `openAddAnnouncementModal()` / `openEditAnnouncementModal(idx)` / `deleteAnnouncement(idx)` — all wrapped in `pinThen`. Announcements are written directly (no pending queue).
- **Delete feedback** (from approved list) — `deleteFeedbackPin(idx)` → `pinThen`.
- **Delete** alumni / faculty / event — `deleteStudentPin` / `deleteFacultyPin` / `deleteEventPin` → `pinThen`.
- **Approve / Reject** any pending submission (alumni add, alumni edit, faculty add, faculty edit, event add, event edit, feedback add, feedback edit, self-registration) — all route through `pinThen`.
- **Restore** alumni or faculty JSON backup — `pinThen(restoreData)` / `pinThen(restoreFaculty)`.

**Pending Approvals (Settings tab):** Nine queues shown in `#pendingList`:
1. Pending Alumni Additions (`saa_pending_alumni`) — `approvePendingAlumni` / `rejectPendingAlumni`
2. Pending Alumni Edits (`saa_pending_edit_alumni`) — `approvePendingEditAlumni` / `rejectPendingEditAlumni`
3. Pending Faculty Additions (`saa_pending_faculty`) — `approvePendingFaculty` / `rejectPendingFaculty`
4. Pending Faculty Edits (`saa_pending_edit_faculty`) — `approvePendingEditFaculty` / `rejectPendingEditFaculty`
5. Pending Events (`saa_pending_events`) — `approvePendingEvent` / `rejectPendingEvent`
6. Pending Event Edits (`saa_pending_edit_events`) — `approvePendingEditEvent` / `rejectPendingEditEvent`
7. Pending Feedback (`saa_pending_feedback`) — `approvePendingFeedback` / `rejectPendingFeedback`
8. Pending Feedback Edits (`saa_pending_edit_feedback`) — `approvePendingEditFeedback` / `rejectPendingEditFeedback`
9. Self-Registrations (`saa_pending_reg`) — `approvePending` / `rejectPending`

`updatePendingBadge()` sums all nine queues for the Settings tab badge.

**Not PIN-protected (open to anyone):** Opening any Add or Edit modal, submitting Add/Edit forms (goes to pending), save display settings (`saveSettings`), backup/export downloads, self-registration submission.

**Contact details privacy:** The Add/Edit modals for alumni and faculty include `Email` and `Cellphone` fields. These are stored in the record (Firestore + localStorage) and visible when editing, but are **never rendered** in the Alumni DB or Faculty dashboard tables. A yellow `.privacy-note` banner in each form informs submitters that contact details are for administrative use only and will not be visible to the public.

**Change Admin PIN** uses its own modal (`openChgPin` / `doChgPin`) that requires entering the current PIN directly — it does not use `pinThen()`.

### Modal Pattern

All modals share a consistent structure: an overlay `<div>` toggled with `display:flex/none`, a close button, and a form that calls a `save*()` function. See `openAddModal()` / `saveStudent()` for the canonical example.

### Seed Data Updates

To update the default dataset visible to all users on first load (or after clearing localStorage), edit the `ALUMNI_SEED` or `FAC_SEED` arrays in `index.html`, then redeploy. Existing users with data in localStorage will not see seed changes unless they restore from a backup or clear their storage.

Seed counts: **321 alumni** across 7 sections (A–G), **15 faculty** records.

### Embedded Images

`BATCH_CLASS_PHOTOS` maps section letter → base64 PNG (class portraits). `HIST_IMGS` is a key→base64 map for history photos; `HIST_PHOTOS` is the ordered metadata array (`{key, cap}`) that controls what is displayed and labeled in the gallery. To relabel a photo edit its `cap`; to hide one remove its entry from `HIST_PHOTOS` (leave `HIST_IMGS` intact to avoid corrupting adjacent base64 data). Adding or replacing images means replacing the base64 string directly in the file, which will further increase file size.

The gallery is fully responsive — CSS Grid with `auto-fill` and `minmax(180px, 1fr)` automatically reflows to fewer columns on smaller screens (typically 2 on mobile, 1 on very small screens). No extra work needed when adding photos.

**Current History gallery (16 photos, keys h001–h017, h009 removed as duplicate):**

| Key | Caption |
|---|---|
| h001 | SAA School Seal - circa 1980s |
| h002 | Historical Photo - circa 1910 |
| h003–h005 | School Building |
| h006–h008 | Faculty Members |
| h010–h016 | Class Photo |
| h017 | School ID - circa 1980s |
